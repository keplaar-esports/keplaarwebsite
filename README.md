To get these files, there are two ways:

1) Download the zip from code -> download ZIP                                               
2) Clone this repository (Make sure git is installed): Copy and paste in terminal-                 
- "git clone https://github.com/jemish072/keplaarwebsite.git"     
- "cd keplaarwebsite" (cd here stands for change directory) 

Now you should have all the files in your system.              
                     
To check the website in your local server, you have two options: 
            
1) If you have Python installed-      
- Copy and paste this in your terminal - "python -m http.server 8000"                    
- Open your browser and go to this link - "http://localhost:8000/"    
                
2) If you do not have Python installed-       
- Go to extension tab (on the left side or ctrl+shift+x)         
- Type live server and install (install the one by Ritwick Dey, its the official one)           
- Go back to Explorer (on the left side or ctrl+shift+e) and select index.html          
- You can run the local server by either clicking on "Go Live" on the bottom right corner or you can right click and select "Open with Live Server"
